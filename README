Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Some example applications to observe the features of RRPGE, to demonstrate the
realization of some typical algorithms with the RRPGE CPU.




Build instructions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Use the RRPGE Assembler in each of the directories. By default (without
parameters) it will take the "main.asm" file, compile the application, and
produce an "app.rpa" which can be started by an RRPGE implementation.
